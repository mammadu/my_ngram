# Welcome to My Ngram
***

## Task

Create a program to display the count of the characters in a string input

## Description

To solve the problem I created an integer array of 127 elements. I then initialized each element to '0'. The arra y index would match to the ascii value of character. The value at the index would match the count.

I then went argument by argument and character by character to increment the count of the character in the array.

Finally I printed each character and its count, if the count was greater than 0.

## Installation

1. Download the repository
2. Go to the repository folder
3. Compile the program using `make`
4. Run the program using `./my_ngram`

## Usage

- `./my_project argument1 argument2`
- `./my_project "argument1" "argument2"`
